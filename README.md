# Temporal-Segment-Networks

This is a simple implementation of a action recognition model using temporal segment networks(the paper is provided below). The python library used in the implementation is Keras.

There are three different jupyter files. The TemporalSeg_RGB uses RGB images to recognize action, TemporalSeg_OpticalFlow uses optical flow images to recognize action and the last uses combined paper with both type of images to recognize action.

I have used one of the datasets mentioned in the official implementation of this paper(https://github.com/yjxiong/temporal-segment-networks). The link to download is:
